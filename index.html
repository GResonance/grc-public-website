		The Gathering Resonance Collective(GRC) is made up of community members who provide space and need-based services for learning, connecting and creating. We have a new home, upstairs, in The Pink House (2474 N. Booth). Our center is available to rent* for classes, workshops, meetings, ceremonies, gatherings and performances. We have open work hours as time permits. To be notified of open hours connect with us via <a href="https://telegram.org">Telegram</a> and connect to <a href="https://t.me/GRC_jess">GRC_Jess</a>.
